TODO

- fix backspace repeat
- need to add nav keys for VIM for this keyboard in VIM config. maybe switchable based on keyb
- TRY in new branch ... holding N or T = SHFIT, holding E or R = CTRL
- on num block/layer use num row keys so shifted versions have symbols as usual
 plus a lot ogf combos here: http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/d9cfb587512441311a230eb27d9f9add
 - try using mouse keys
- fix terminal open ... what happened to screen lock
- consider switching layer/nav thumb keys to around so opposite site thumb key from key layer keys. e.g. NUM layer key on left. NUM keys on right. 
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
- use a left hand home row modifier for triggering UMLAUTE
>>>>>>> HOMI


DONE
- move vim escape to a different combination - now top inner keys
- flip inner and outer thumb keys around. inner will be space/backspace. outer will be layer modifiers
- fix umlaute. only works on qwerty layer because of COMBO_ONLY_LAYER 0 rule. same keys onn all layers. fix by removing QWERTY layer ..... QWERTY layer has been removed
